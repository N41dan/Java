	/*
	 
	 Requirements:

	1, Create a class called Person with the following attributes:
	
	name (String)
	age (int)
	address (String)
	
	1.5, Implement encapsulation by making the name, age, and address attributes private.
	
	2, Create public getter and setter methods for each attribute.
	
	3, Implement validation in the setter methods to ensure that the age attribute 
	   is between 0 and 120, and that the name and address attributes are not empty.
	
	4, Create a constructor for the Person class that accepts values for the name, 
	   age, and address attributes and initializes them using the setter methods.
	
	5, Create a class called Main that creates two Person objects and sets 
	   their attributes using the constructor.
	
	6, Print out the details of the two Person objects using the getter methods.
	
	
	output:
	
	Person 1:
			Name: John Doe
			Age: 35
			Address: 123 Main St

	Person 2:
			Name: Jane Smith
			Age: 28
			Address: 456 Elm St
