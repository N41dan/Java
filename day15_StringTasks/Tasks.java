	 Your team has created a new bank website that requires email address to be validated. 
	 The email string must contain an '@' character. 
	 The email string must contain an '.' character. 
	 The '@' must contain at least one character in front of it.
	  e.g. "a@example.com" is valid while "@example.com" is invalid. 
	  The '.' and '@' must be in the appropriate places. 
	  e.g. "mike.smith@com" is invalid while "mike.smith@example.com" is valid. 
	  For a given string, find a solution that writes true on the console if an email is valid 
	  and false if it is invalid. 
	  Examples: 
	  str = "test@example.com" --> true 
	  str = "test@example.co.in --> true 
	  str = "@example.com" --> false
